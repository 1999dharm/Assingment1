    "\n",
    "Ans The Unit Vector technique in feature scaling, also known as normalization or unit normalization, is another method used to rescale features in a dataset. Unlike Min-Max scaling, which maps the values to a specific range, Unit Vector scaling transforms the values of each feature to have a magnitude of 1 while preserving their relative directions.\n",

    "Q3. What is PCA (Principle Component Analysis), and how is it used in dimensionality reduction? Provide an example to illustrate its application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a statistical technique used for dimensionality reduction in data analysis. It aims to transform a dataset containing a large number of variables (or features) into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables called principal components. These principal components capture the maximum amount of information from the original dataset while minimizing the loss of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA works by identifying the directions (principal components) along which the data varies the most. The first principal component captures the largest amount of variance in the dataset, and subsequent components capture decreasing amounts of variance. By selecting a subset of these principal components, we can reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining as much information as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the application of PCA for dimensionality reduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset with three variables: height, weight, and age, for a set of individuals:\n",

    "155 50 25\n",
    "180 75 40\n",
    "162 55 35\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply PCA, we first standardize the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each variable. This step ensures that all variables are on the same scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we calculate the covariance matrix of the standardized data. The covariance matrix represents the relationships between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are then computed. The eigenvectors represent the principal components, and the eigenvalues indicate the amount of variance explained by each component.\n",
    "\n",
    "We sort the eigenvalues in descending order and select the top k eigenvectors corresponding to the highest eigenvalues. These eigenvectors form the basis for the reduced-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we choose to retain the top two principal components with the highest eigenvalues.\n",
    "\n",
    "We project the original data onto the new space spanned by these two principal components. This projection reduces the dimensionality of the dataset from three variables to two variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans \n",

    "ChatGPT\n",
    "PCA and feature extraction are closely related concepts. In fact, PCA can be used as a technique for feature extraction.\n",

    "Feature extraction refers to the process of selecting or creating a smaller set of features from a larger set of original features. The goal is to create a more compact representation of the data while preserving as much relevant information as possible.\n",

    "PCA can be employed as a feature extraction technique by using the principal components obtained from the PCA analysis. Instead of using all the original features, we can select a subset of the principal components as the new features.\n",
