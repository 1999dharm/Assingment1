    "Q1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode\n",
    "of file opening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans1\n",
    " In Python, the built-in open() function is used to open a file. The open() function takes two arguments: the name of the file to be opened, and the mode in which the file should be opened. The mode specifies how the file should be opened for reading or writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several modes for opening a file in Python, each with a different purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "'r' - Read mode: This is the default mode for opening a file in Python. It opens the file for reading only, and any attempt to write to the file will result in an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "'w' - Write mode: This mode opens the file for writing only, and any existing data in the file will be truncated. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "'a' - Append mode: This mode opens the file for writing, but unlike the write mode, it appends the data to the end of the file instead of truncating the existing data. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "'x' - Exclusive creation mode: This mode is similar to write mode, but it raises an error if the file already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "'b' - Binary mode: This mode is used when working with binary files, such as images, audio or video files.\n",
    "\n",
    "'+' - Update mode: This mode opens the file for both reading and writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use multiple modes at once, for example, to open a file in binary mode for reading and writing, you would use 'rb+'.\n",

    "Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file\n",
    "\n",
    "AnsThe close() function is used to close a file in Python. It is important to close a file after you have finished working with it because it frees up system resources and ensures that any changes made to the file are properly saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open a file, the operating system reserves a portion of memory to store the file's data, and this memory is not released until you close the file. If you have a large number of files open at the same time, it can lead to memory exhaustion, which can cause your program to crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Closing a file also ensures that any changes you made to the file while it was open are saved and committed to disk. If you do not close a file, any changes you made to it may not be saved or may be lost if your program crashes or the system shuts down.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is generally a good practice to use the with statement when opening files in Python. This ensures that the file is properly closed even if an exception occurs while the file is open. For example:\n",
