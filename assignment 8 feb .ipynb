    "Abstraction and encapsulation are two fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). Although they are often used interchangeably, they are different concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details of a class and exposing only the necessary information to the user. It's a way of representing the essential features without including the background details or implementation. The main idea behind abstraction is to simplify the complexity of the code and to focus on what the object does, rather than how it does it.\n",

    "Encapsulation, on the other hand, is the technique of wrapping the data (variables) and the code that manipulates the data (methods) inside a single unit or object. Encapsulation provides a way to hide the internal state of an object from the outside world, making it accessible only through the methods defined by the object's class. This helps to ensure data security and prevent unintended modification.\n",

The implementation details of how the deposit and withdrawal operations are performed could be complex, but the user of the bank account class doesn't need to know these details. The abstraction provided by the deposit() and withdrawal() methods allows the user to perform these operations by simply calling these methods, without worrying about the implementation details.\n",

    "Encapsulation is used to protect the internal state of the bank account class from being modified directly by the user.

    "In this example, the Animal class is defined as an abstract class, which serves as a blueprint for other classes. It has an abstract method make_sound, which must be implemented by any concrete class that inherits from Animal. The Dog class is a concrete class that inherits from Animal and provides an implementation for the make_sound method. An instance of the Dog class can be created, as it has provided an implementation for all of the abstract methods defined in the abstract class. However, it does not make sense to create an instance of the abstract class Animal, as it is not a complete class on its own and cannot be used without being subclassed.\n"
