    "Q1. Explain why we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception.\n",
    "Note: Here Exception class refers to the base class for all the exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans When creating a custom exception in Python, it is important to inherit from the built-in Exception class or one of its subclasses. The Exception class provides a standardized way of handling errors in Python and is the base class for all built-in exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Exception class as the base class for a custom exception allows the new exception to inherit all of the properties and behaviors of the base class, such as the ability to raise and catch the exception using standard Python exception handling mechanisms. Additionally, the Exception class provides a number of built-in methods and attributes that can be useful when creating a custom exception, such as the __str__ method for defining a custom error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheriting from the Exception class also ensures that the new exception is consistent with the rest of the Python language and follows established best practices for error handling. This can make the code more maintainable and easier to understand for other developers who may need to work with the code in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, using the Exception class as the base class for a custom exception helps to ensure that the exception behaves in a predictable and consistent manner and integrates seamlessly with the rest of the Python language and its built-in error handling mechanisms."

    "Q6. List down some best practices for exception handling in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans Use specific exception types: Catching specific exceptions allows you to handle different errors differently. You can use a more generic exception, such as Exception, if you want to catch all exceptions. However, this can make it difficult to debug problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use try-except blocks judiciously: Use try-except blocks only when you expect errors to occur. Otherwise, errors can be hidden, and you may end up with unexpected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid catching all exceptions: Catching all exceptions with a bare except statement can make it difficult to debug problems. You should only catch specific exceptions that you expect to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep exception messages informative: Exception messages should be clear and informative, so that users can understand what went wrong and take appropriate action. You can customize exception messages to provide more information about the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use context managers: Use context managers, such as with, to automatically handle resource allocation and release. This can help to avoid resource leaks and other errors that can occur when resources are not properly handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid using exceptions for control flow: Exceptions should be used to handle exceptional conditions, not as a means of control flow. Using exceptions for control flow can make code harder to understand and maintain.\n",
