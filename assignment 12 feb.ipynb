    "Q1.what is an exception in python ? write the different between exceptions and syntax errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans\n",
    "   In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exception is raised, the normal flow of the program is interrupted, and the program looks for a way to handle the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "An syntax error, on the other hand, is a type of error that occurs when the Python interpreter encounters incorrect code syntax. Syntax errors are usually raised before the program is executed and are caused by mistakes in the code, such as incorrect use of quotes, parenthesis, or indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that exceptions occur during the execution of a program, while syntax errors occur before the program is executed. Exceptions are raised when unexpected conditions occur in the program, such as dividing by zero, accessing an index that does not exist in a list, or trying to open a file that does not exist. Syntax errors, on the other hand, are a result of incorrect code that does not conform to the syntax rules of the Python language."

    "   When an exception is not handled, the program terminates abruptly and generates an error message. The error message provides information about the type of exception that was raised and its location in the code. This makes it difficult to determine the cause of the exception and fix the problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "The main reason for creating custom exceptions is to provide a more meaningful and user-friendly error message that is specific to the program. Custom exceptions can be raised in response to specific conditions in the program, and they can be caught and handled just like any other exception. By using custom exceptions, you can create a more informative and organized error handling mechanism for your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a program that performs operations on a set of data. You may want to raise a custom exception if the data is not in a valid format, rather than using a generic ValueError exception. In this case, you could create a custom exception class called InvalidDataFormatException, and raise an instance of this exception whenever the data is not in the expected format."
