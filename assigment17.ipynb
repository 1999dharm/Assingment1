    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented data model. Unlike traditional relational databases like SQL, MongoDB is designed to be highly scalable and flexible, with a dynamic schema that allows for changes in data structure without requiring a pre-defined schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases like MongoDB are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data, making them ideal for use cases where data is diverse or unstructured, such as in big data applications, social media, or Internet of Things (IoT) devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the scenarios where it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "High scalability: MongoDB is horizontally scalable, meaning it can distribute data across multiple servers, making it ideal for high-traffic applications where scalability is a priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: MongoDB's dynamic schema allows for changes to be made to data structures without requiring a pre-defined schema, which is useful in cases where data models are not known in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "High performance: MongoDB's data model is optimized for querying and indexing, making it faster than SQL databases for some use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geospatial data: MongoDB has built-in support for geospatial data, making it ideal for location-based applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud-based applications: MongoDB has native integration with cloud-based services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure, making it a good choice for cloud-based applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, MongoDB is well-suited for applications that require high scalability, flexibility, and performance with unstructured or semi-structured data."

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that offers several features that make it well-suited for modern application development. Some of the key features of MongoDB are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-oriented data model: MongoDB uses a document-oriented data model, which means that data is stored in documents rather than tables. Documents are collections of key-value pairs, making them more flexible and easier to work with than tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic schema: MongoDB has a dynamic schema, which means that you can store documents without a pre-defined structure. This makes it easier to work with data that is diverse or unstructured.\n",
    "\n",
    "High availability: MongoDB offers automatic replication and failover, which ensures that your data is always available even in the event of hardware failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Horizontal scalability: MongoDB is designed to be horizontally scalable, which means that it can handle large amounts of data by distributing it across multiple servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing and querying: MongoDB has a flexible query language and supports secondary indexes, making it easy to search and retrieve data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation: MongoDB supports aggregation, which is the process of grouping and analyzing data across multiple documents or collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geospatial data: MongoDB has built-in support for geospatial data, making it ideal for location-based applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Full-text search: MongoDB provides full-text search capabilities, which enables developers to easily build search functionality into their applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Native integration with cloud-based services: MongoDB has native integration with cloud-based services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure, making it a good choice for cloud-based applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, MongoDB offers a powerful set of features that make it a flexible and scalable solution for modern application development. Its document-oriented data model, dynamic schema, and support for indexing and querying, aggregation, and geospatial data make it particularly well-suited for handling diverse or unstructured data.\n"

    "Q3. Write a code to connect MongoDB to Python. Also, create a database and a collection in MongoDB.\n",
