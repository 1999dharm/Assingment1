    "Q1. What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans Lasso regression is a linear regression technique that adds a penalty term to the objective function in order to shrink the coefficients of the model towards zero. This penalty term is based on the L1-norm of the coefficients, which means that it encourages sparsity by setting some of the coefficients to exactly zero. The resulting model can be used for feature selection, as the non-zero coefficients correspond to the most important features in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to other regression techniques, such as Ridge regression, which uses a penalty term based on the L2-norm of the coefficients, Lasso regression is more likely to produce sparse models with fewer variables. In addition, Lasso regression can be used for variable selection and to remove noise from the data, making it a useful tool for dealing with high-dimensional datasets. However, Lasso regression can be sensitive to correlated variables, and it may not work as well when the number of variables is larger than the number of observations"

    "Q2. What is the main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans The main advantage of using Lasso Regression for feature selection is that it can automatically identify and select the most important features in a dataset. By adding a penalty term based on the L1-norm of the coefficients to the objective function of the linear regression model, Lasso Regression encourages sparsity by setting some of the coefficients to exactly zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that Lasso Regression can effectively shrink the coefficients of the less important features towards zero, effectively removing them from the model. The resulting model contains only the features with non-zero coefficients, which can lead to improved predictive performance and better interpretability of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, Lasso Regression can also help to reduce overfitting by regularizing the model and preventing it from fitting the noise in the data. This is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets, where the number of features is much larger than the number of observations. By selecting only the most important features, Lasso Regression can help to simplify the model and reduce the risk of overfitting."

    "Q3. How do you interpret the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans The coefficients of a Lasso Regression model can be interpreted in the same way as the coefficients of a standard linear regression model. The coefficients represent the change in the dependent variable (y) for a unit change in the independent variable (x), while holding all other independent variables constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in Lasso Regression, some of the coefficients may be set exactly to zero, which means that the corresponding independent variables are not included in the model. This can be useful for feature selection, as it allows us to identify the most important variables in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the size of the coefficients in a Lasso Regression model can also be used to interpret the importance of the independent variables. Larger coefficients indicate that the corresponding variables have a stronger influence on the dependent variable, while smaller coefficients indicate a weaker influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that Lasso Regression can also be used to identify interactions between variables. In this case, the coefficients represent the change in the dependent variable for a unit change in one variable, while holding all other variables constant, including any interactions terms.\n",

    "Q4. What are the tuning parameters that can be adjusted in Lasso Regression, and how do they affect the\n",
    "model's performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans There are two main tuning parameters that can be adjusted in Lasso Regression: the alpha parameter and the lambda parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The alpha parameter controls the balance between the L1-norm penalty and the L2-norm penalty in the objective function. When alpha is set to 1, Lasso Regression is equivalent to the L1-norm penalty, and when alpha is set to 0, it is equivalent to Ridge Regression with the L2-norm penalty. In general, setting alpha to a value between 0 and 1 can help to balance the trade-off between sparsity and bias in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lambda parameter controls the strength of the penalty term in the objective function. A larger lambda value will result in a stronger penalty and a sparser model with fewer non-zero coefficients. However, if lambda is set too high, the model may become overly simple and lose predictive power. On the other hand, if lambda is set too low, the model may overfit the data and not generalize well to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of tuning parameters in Lasso Regression can have a significant impact on the performance of the model. A good approach is to use cross-validation to find the optimal values for alpha and lambda that minimize the prediction error on a validation set. In general, a good Lasso Regression model should balance the trade-off between sparsity and predictive power, and the choice of tuning parameters will depend on the specific characteristics of the data and the modeling goals."

    "Q5. Can Lasso Regression be used for non-linear regression problems? If yes, how?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans Yes, Lasso Regression can be used for non-linear regression problems by incorporating non-linear transformations of the independent variables into the model. This is done by creating new features that are derived from the original features through a non-linear function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the relationship between the dependent variable and an independent variable is non-linear, we can add a new feature that is the square of the independent variable. This will allow the model to capture the non-linear relationship between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, any non-linear transformation can be used, such as logarithmic or exponential functions, as long as they are applied consistently to both the training and test data. However, it's important to keep in mind that adding non-linear terms to the model can also increase the risk of overfitting, so it's important to use regularization techniques such as Lasso Regression to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model.\n",

    "Ans Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression are both regularization techniques used in linear regression to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model. However, they differ in the type of penalty used to regularize the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression uses the L2-norm penalty, which adds a term proportional to the sum of the squares of the coefficients to the objective function. This penalty shrinks the coefficients of the less important features towards zero, but does not set them exactly to zero. This means that Ridge Regression can be used for feature selection, but it will not eliminate any features from the model completely.\n",

    "Lasso Regression, on the other hand, uses the L1-norm penalty, which adds a term proportional to the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients to the objective function.

This makes Lasso Regression a useful tool for feature selection, as it can identify and select only the most important features in the data.\n",

    "Q7. Can Lasso Regression handle multicollinearity in the input features? If yes, how?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans Yes, Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity in the input features to some extent, but it may not completely solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated with each other. This can lead to instability in the model, as the coefficients of the correlated variables can be highly sensitive to small changes in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lasso Regression, the L1-norm penalty can help to address multicollinearity by shrinking the coefficients of the correlated variables towards zero. This can effectively remove some of the correlated variables from the model, leaving only the most important ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Lasso Regression may not completely solve the problem of multicollinearity, as it can only select one variable from a group of highly correlated variables. This means that there may still be some residual correlation among the remaining variables in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address multicollinearity more effectively, other techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression can be used to transform the input features into a set of uncorrelated variables before applying Lasso Regression. This can help to reduce the impact of multicollinearity on the model and improve its performance.\n",
