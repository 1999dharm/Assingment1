        "1. Who developed Python Programming Language? \n",
        "Ans. Python programming language was developed by Guido van Rossum in 1989.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Which type of Programming does Python support? \n",
        "Ans. Python supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Is Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers? \n",
        "Ans. Yes, Python is case sensitive when dealing with identifiers (such as variable names, function names, etc.). For example, the names \"var1\" and \"Var1\" would be treated as two different variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the correct extension of the Python file? \n",
        "Ans. The correct extension of a Python file is \".py\".\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Is Python code compiled or interpreted? \n",
        "Ans. Python code is interpreted, not compiled. This means that the code is executed line by line at runtime, rather than being translated into machine code before the program is run.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language? \n",
        "Ans. def for defining functions.\n",
        "if for conditional statements.\n",
        "for and while for looping constructs.\n",
        "try and except for handling exceptions.\n",
        "with for context management.\n",
        "class for defining classes.\n",
        "import for importing modules.\n",
        "return for returning values from a function.\n",
        "raise for raising exceptions.\n",
        "pass as a placeholder for empty blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. State a character used to give single-line comments in Python? \n",
        "Ans. The symbol # is used for single-line comments in Python.\n",

        "pythpy\n",
        "SKILLS\n",
        "8. Mention functions which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on? \n",
        "Ans. sys.version: This is a string that provides information about the Python version you are running, including the release number, build date, and other details.sys.version_info: This is a named tuple that provides information about the Python version you are running, including the major, minor, and micro version numbers, as well as any release level and serial number.\n",
        "\n",
        "platform.python_version(): This function returns a string that provides the Python version in the format \"major.minor.micro\", without any additional information.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called.\n",
        "Ans. \"lambda.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What does pip stand for python?\n",
        "Ans. \"pip\" stands for \"Pip Installs Packages.\" It is a package management system for installing and managing packages in the Python programming language. Pip makes it easier to install and manage third-party packages for your Python project, by handling the downloading, installation, and maintenance of the packages for you.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "11. Mention a few built-in functions in python? \n",
        "Ans. print(): prints the specified message to the screen.\n",
        "len(): returns the length of an object.\n",
        "int(): converts a number or string to an integer.\n",
        "float(): converts a number or string to a floating-point number\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in Python? \n",
        "Ans. There is no fixed limit to the length of an identifier in Python. However, it is advised to keep the length of identifiers reasonable, as too long of an identifier can make your code harder to read and maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What are the benefits of using Python? \n",
        "Ans. Easy to learn and use: Python has a simple and intuitive syntax, making it easy for new programmers to pick up and start coding.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "14. How is memory managed in Python? \n",
        "Ans. Memory management in Python is handled by the Python Memory Manager, which is part of the Python runtime system. The memory manager is responsible for allocating and freeing memory as needed by the Python objects.\n",
        "Python uses a reference-counting system to keep track of the references to objects in memory. When an object is no longer being referenced by any part of the program, its reference count drops to zero and the memory manager automatically frees the memory associated with that object.\n",
        "Additionally, Python uses a garbage collector to collect and remove objects that are no longer being used by the program, even if their reference count is not zero. The garbage collector runs periodically and frees up memory that is no longer needed by the program.\n",
        "In summary, Python's memory management system is automatic and efficient, freeing the programmer from having to manually manage memory allocation and freeing.\n",

        "15. How to install Python on Windows and set path variables?\n",
        "Ans. Download the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n",
        "1. Run the installation file and follow the on-screen instructions. Make sure to select the option to add Python to your system PATH.\n",
        "2. Open the Command Prompt and type python to check if Python is installed and the PATH variables are set correctly.\n",
        "3. To set the PATH variables, open the Start menu, right-click on Computer, and select Properties.\n",
        "4. Click on Advanced system settings and then click on the Environment Variables button.\n",
        "5. In the System Variables section, scroll down and find the Path variable, then click on Edit.\n",
        "6. Add the path to your Python installation (e.g. C:\\Python3x\\) to the Path variable.\n",
        "7. Restart the Command Prompt for the changes to take effect.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",

        "8. To check if the PATH variables are set correctly, type python in the Command Prompt again. The Python interpreter should start, and you should see the Python prompt >>>.\n",
