    "A z-test is used when the population standard deviation is known, and the sample size is large (typically greater than 30).

    "A one-tailed test is a statistical test in which the hypothesis is directional, and the region of rejection is located entirely in one tail of the distribution. It is used when there is a specific prediction about the direction of the difference between two groups or conditions.

    "Type 1 error, also known as a false positive, occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected when it is actually true. This means that the test incorrectly concludes that there is a significant difference between the two groups being compared when there is no actual difference.

    "An example of a Type 1 error is when a medical test produces a false positive result. For instance, a patient is diagnosed with a disease even though they do not have it. This can lead to unnecessary medical treatment, causing physical, emotional, and financial harm to the patient.\n",

    "Type 2 error, also known as a false negative, occurs when the null hypothesis is not rejected when it is actually false. This means that the test incorrectly concludes that there is no significant difference between the two groups being compared when there is an actual difference.

    "Q4: Explain Bayes's theorem with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans Bayes's theorem is a statistical theorem that describes the probability of an event occurring based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. Bayes's theorem is often used to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence or data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for Bayes's theorem is:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)\n",

The prevalence of the disease in the population is 1 in 1000. A patient tests positive for the disease. What is the probability that the patient actually has the disease?\n",

    "Ans example.\n",

    "A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true value of a population parameter, such as the population mean or proportion, with a certain level of confidence. It provides a measure of the precision of an estimate based on a sample from the population.\n",
